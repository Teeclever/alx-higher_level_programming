## Introduction

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language used in various domains such as web development, data science, machine learning, and more. This repository aims to provide a structured overview of Python concepts, from the basics to advanced topics, to assist learners at all levels.


 ## Getting Started

If you are new to Python, start with the basics. Familiarize yourself with the Python syntax, data types, and control flow structures. The Getting Started directory contains resources for beginners.
Basic Concepts

Explore fundamental Python concepts, including:

   - Variables and Data Types
 - Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception Handling

Each concept is organized in its respective directory under Basic Concepts.
Advanced Topics

Delve into more advanced Python topics, such as:

  -  Decorators
  -  Generators
  -  Context Managers
  -  Multithreading and Multiprocessing
  -  File Handling
  -  Regular Expressions

Find detailed explanations and examples in the Advanced Topics directory.

```python
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    print(f"Welcome {name} to python programming language")


    >>>>
    please enter your name: Omotayo
   >>>> Welcome Omotayo to python programming


```

## Zen of Python 


<details>
<summary>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</summary>
<br>
Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
